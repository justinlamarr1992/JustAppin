Connect the login with google and email in login and register with the 
createOrUpdateUser/ currentUser in the client/ functions in order to 
create the user or update them in the database

Loging in and getting the accesstoken do not access the database. 
This only allows the google server to say hey we handled the auth
Not here is the user you saved and created in mongo
have to make connect (FIGURE it out)
